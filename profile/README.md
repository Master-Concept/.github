## Getting Started

To get started as a new member of our GitHub organization, please follow these steps:

1. **Create your GitHub account**: If you don't have a GitHub account yet, sign up at [https://github.com/join](https://github.com/join). Choose a username that follows the format `[nickname]-[lastname]-hkmci`, e.g., `jdoe-doe-hkmci`.

2. **Set up your profile**: Add a professional profile picture, your full name, and your HKMCI email address to your GitHub profile. Make sure to enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for added security.

3. **Request access**: Find Peter Chan at peter.chan@hkmci.com from Google Chat to request access to the HKMCI GitHub organization. Please provide your GitHub username and the specific teams or repositories you need access to.

4. **Explore our repositories**: Once you've been granted access, take some time to explore our organization's repositories. Read through the READMEs, review the codebase, and familiarize yourself with our projects and coding standards.

5. **Introduce yourself**: Create a new issue in our [onboarding repository]([link-to-repo](https://github.com/Master-Concept/Onboarding)) to introduce yourself to the team. Share your background, skills, research interests, and what you're excited to work on at Master Concept.
